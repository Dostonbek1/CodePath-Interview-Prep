'''
A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.

Return a deep copy of the list.

The Linked List is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:

    val: an integer representing Node.val
    random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) where random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.

Constraints:
    -10000 <= Node.val <= 10000
    Node.random is null or pointing to a node in the linked list.
    Number of Nodes will not exceed 1000.
